You are editing this project:
- Script: gerber-to-dxf.py
- Documentation: README.md

Project purpose:
- Generate one DXF file from fabrication files in the current folder.
- Output file format: <project>-outline-mounting-holes.dxf
- DXF layers:
  - OUTLINE: board profile from edge-cuts Gerber geometry
  - MOUNTING_HOLES: selected drill holes as CIRCLE entities

Current behavior requirements:
1. Auto-detect input files:
- Edge profile: *-Edge_Cuts.gbr, with profile fallback detection for other .gbr files.
- Drill files: *-PTH.drl and *-NPTH.drl when present.

2. Geometry handling:
- Preserve board outline geometry from Gerber (LINE/ARC).
- Read source units correctly (inch/mm) and write DXF in millimeters.
- Keep original coordinate orientation from fabrication files.

3. Hole filtering CLI:
- Use command-line flags:
  - --min : minimum drill diameter in mm (default: 3.0)
  - --max : maximum drill diameter in mm (default: none / no maximum)
- Validate:
  - --min >= 0
  - --max >= 0 when provided
  - --max >= --min when provided

4. Runtime output:
- On normal run, script prints command-line help text and then summary:
  - output filename
  - outline entity count
  - hole count using active filter
  - diameters used

5. Documentation sync:
- If behavior or parameters change, update README.md in the same commit.
- README must include Windows/macOS/Linux usage examples.
- Keep note: tested with KiCad 9.0.
- Keep note at the end that work was AI generated.

Editing rules for future Codex runs:
- Make focused, minimal edits; do not rewrite unrelated logic.
- Preserve existing file naming conventions unless explicitly requested.
- After edits, run quick checks:
  - python3 gerber-to-dxf.py --help
  - python3 gerber-to-dxf.py (or with sample --min/--max)
- Report what changed and reference exact files.

Task template for next changes:
"Update gerber-to-dxf.py to [requested change].
Keep CLI defaults as --min=3.0 and --max unset unless I explicitly ask otherwise.
Update README.md to match behavior and verify with a quick command run."
